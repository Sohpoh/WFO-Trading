"""Walk-forward optimization engine.

Prevents curve-fitting by never scoring a parameter set on the same data it
trades: for each fold, strategy parameters are grid-searched on a trailing
`train_weeks` window and then applied, untouched, to the following blind
`test_weeks` window. Only the out-of-sample (test window) returns are
stitched together into the final walk-forward equity curve.

For comparison, `run_retail_insample` reproduces what a retail trader
typically does instead: optimize once on the *entire* dataset and trade that
single curve-fit parameter set across all of it (in-sample).

    """Assemble the searched params into `strategy.generate_positions()` kwargs.

    Three params are searched, and they are the strategy's only three degrees
    of freedom:
      - `min_gap_pct` — how far below the previous UTC day's final close the
        current Close has to sit before the gap is worth fading (the lower
        edge of the entry band).
      - `stop_gap_frac` — the hard stop, as a fraction of that gap distance,
        measured from the entry Close.
      - `target_frac` — the profit target, as a fraction of the way back up to
        the anchor (1.0 = the literal full fill).

    One param is fixed and threaded into every combo as-is, never searched:
    `session` (required by CLAUDE.md).

    The band's UPPER edge is not here at all: it is `strategy.BAND_CAP_MULT`
    (3.0x `min_gap_pct`), a module constant deliberately kept off the search
    axes so the entry keeps exactly one width degree of freedom. Beyond 3x the
    threshold the overnight move is read as news rather than a fadeable
    overshoot, and that cap is also what bounds re-arming after a stop-out.

    No cross-param filter is applied, and none is needed: every combination of
    the three is a valid strategy (there is no degenerate pair the way a
    `fast_ma >= slow_ma` pair would be), so no CLI override can silently empty
    the grid.

    Type discipline (see CLAUDE.md and `_max_lookback_bars()` below):
      - ALL THREE are cast to `float` **on purpose**. `min_gap_pct` is a
        return threshold; `stop_gap_frac` and `target_frac` are fractions of a
        price distance. None is a bar count, so none should feed the
        pre-test-window warm-up buffer. The casts are defensive: a grid point
        hand-written as `1` would otherwise arrive as an `int` and inflate
        that buffer for no reason.
      - Consequently `_max_lookback_bars()` returns **0** for this grid, which
        INVERTS the coverage hazard every previous iteration warned about:
        `run_walk_forward()`'s fold-skip guard drops to `len(train_df) < 10`,
        trivially met at every timeframe, so no fold can be silently skipped
        and there is no "must use --timeframe 15min" constraint here.
      - The warm-up buffer therefore collapses to `_bars_per_day(df) + 5` —
        precisely the day-anchored floor that function exists for, since this
        strategy's only history requirement is day-boundary-anchored rather
        than an N-bar rolling window. That leg is invisible to
        `_max_lookback_bars()` and so is hand-checked, in
        `strategy.py`'s module docstring: the true requirement is at most
        (bars of the current UTC day preceding `test_start`) + 1 = the max
        bars in one UTC day. Measured on the local NQ frame (median/max bars
        per UTC day -> buffer vs. requirement): 1min 1380/1380 -> 1385 vs
        1380; 5min 276/276 -> 281 vs 276; 15min 92/92 -> 97 vs 92; 1h 23/23 ->
        28 vs 23; 4h 6/6 -> 15 vs 6. Every timeframe clears it. If one ever
        did not, the failure is a NaN anchor -> no entry on the first bars of
        a test window: missed trades, never lookahead.
