"""Walk-forward optimization engine.

Prevents curve-fitting by never scoring a parameter set on the same data it
trades: for each fold, strategy parameters are grid-searched on a trailing
`train_weeks` window and then applied, untouched, to the following blind
`test_weeks` window. Only the out-of-sample (test window) returns are
stitched together into the final walk-forward equity curve.

For comparison, `run_retail_insample` reproduces what a retail trader
typically does instead: optimize once on the *entire* dataset and trade that
single curve-fit parameter set across all of it (in-sample).

    """Assemble the searched params into `strategy.generate_positions()` kwargs.

    Two params are searched: `formation_lookback` (how many completed bars the
    momentum statistic `Close_t / Close_{t-n} - 1` measures over) and
    `rank_pct` (how deep into the trailing distribution of that statistic a
    bar has to rank before the strategy goes long). Nothing else is tunable:
    the strategy's exit is a hard stop at a fixed 0.6x its trailing daily
    range with an unreachable target (so winners still run to `session.py`'s
    forced flatten), and both of those are module constants in `strategy.py`,
    deliberately NOT searched axes — the family's diagnosed failure mode is an
    overfit gap, so the stop is kept at zero degrees of freedom.

    Two params are fixed and threaded into every combo as-is, never searched:
    `session` (required by CLAUDE.md) and `rank_window`.

    Type discipline (see CLAUDE.md and `_max_lookback_bars()` below):
      - `formation_lookback` and `rank_window` are both cast to plain `int`
        **on purpose** — both are genuine bar counts and both should feed the
        pre-test-window warm-up buffer.
      - `rank_window` is the larger, so it is what sizes that buffer:
        `buffer_bars = max((960 + 5) * 3, day_bars + 5)` = 2895 bars, which
        covers the signal's true requirement of
        `rank_window + max(formation_lookback)` = 960 + 192 = 1152. The
        stop's trailing-daily-range windows live in `strategy.py` as module
        constants (96 and 960 bars) and so are invisible to
        `_max_lookback_bars()`; hand-checked, they warm at bar 1056, i.e.
        inside the 1152 the signal leg already requires, so the binding
        requirement is unchanged.
      - `rank_pct` is cast to `float` on purpose — it is a quantile level in
        (0, 1), never a bar count. The cast is defensive: a grid point written
        as `1` would otherwise arrive as an `int` and inflate the buffer.

    COVERAGE HAZARD — do not raise `rank_window` (and be careful pointing this
    strategy at a coarse timeframe) without redoing this arithmetic:
    `run_walk_forward()` below skips any fold whose train window holds fewer
    than `max_lookback + 10` bars, i.e. 970 here. A 12-week train window at
    15min is ~5,700 bars and a 3-week test window ~1,900, so the guard is
    comfortable at the intended timeframe. 1h (~1,400 bars per 12-week train
    window) still clears it, with ~40% headroom; 4h (~350) does not, and every
    fold there would be silently skipped — the iteration-31 failure mode.
